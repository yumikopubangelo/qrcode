# qrcode
This project was requested by the student council (OSIS) at my school. Its aim is to create QR codes as a method of entry tickets for a major event organized by the student council. In this project, I utilized an object-oriented programming (OOP) approach using Python, a language I am proficient in.

Employing OOP, I designed a program structure consisting of classes representing entities and functions involved in generating and managing QR code entry tickets. One class might represent the entry ticket itself, with attributes such as event information, a unique identification number, and possibly details about the ticket holder.

Subsequently, there would be another class responsible for generating the QR code from the given entry ticket information. Additionally, I may require additional classes to handle ticket validation, ticket database management, or even a user interface to facilitate ticket printing or payment.

By employing an OOP approach, I can break the project down into clearly defined units, facilitating code development and maintenance. Moreover, this approach allows me to create modular, easily understandable code that can be easily expanded upon if there are additional requirements or changes in the future.
